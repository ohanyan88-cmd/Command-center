# Activation inputs — Deputy integrations (Telegram · WhatsApp · Bitrix24 · MikroBILL)

Everything in code, contracts, tests and evals for these integrations is production-ready. What remains for each is only:

`CONFIGURE → IDENTITY VERIFY → REAL READ → LIVE CERTIFY → OPTIONAL CONTROLLED WRITE CERTIFY`

No secret ever enters Git, the audit, the durable export, an approval card or an error message. Secrets live **outside the repository**, in one of two places (the environment wins over the file):

| Where | Shape |
|---|---|
| Environment | `CC_<INTEGRATION_ID with - → _>_<FIELD>` — e.g. `CC_INT_TG_BOT_TOKEN` |
| File | `~/.command-center/integrations/<INTEGRATION_ID>.json` — a flat JSON object with the field names below |

Check the state at any time (values are never printed, only field NAMES):

```
python .claude/integrations/integration.py readiness
python .claude/integrations/integration.py certify        # real identity + read certification (read-only)
```

## INT-TG — Telegram (official Bot API)

**Required**

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `bot_token` | the token BotFather gave for Deputy's bot (`123456789:AA…`) |
| `allowed_chat_ids` | comma-separated chat ids (groups are negative, e.g. `-1001234567890`) whose messages count as business evidence |

**Optional**

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `allowed_user_ids` | user ids allowed in private chats with the bot |
| `expected_bot_username` | e.g. `deputy_housenet_bot` — identity is VERIFIED only when getMe matches |
| `mode` | `polling` (default, no public endpoint needed) or `webhook` |
| `webhook_secret` | required in webhook mode; Telegram sends it in `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` |
| `observe_unknown` | `true` to keep messages from non-allowlisted chats as UNTRUSTED evidence (default: dropped) |

Template `~/.command-center/integrations/INT-TG.json`:

```json
{"bot_token": "<BotFather token>", "allowed_chat_ids": "-1001234567890,123456789", "allowed_user_ids": "123456789", "expected_bot_username": "deputy_housenet_bot", "mode": "polling"}
```

**Activation steps** — 1) create the bot in BotFather, 2) add it to the allowed group(s) / start it in private chats, 3) put the config outside Git, 4) `integration.py certify` → identity VERIFIED (getMe = expected username) → `chat.messages` REAL READ → VERIFIED_READ, 5) optional write certification: Deputy prepares one `chat.send` to an allowed chat, Gev approves, the message is sent; the Bot API returns a message id (provider acceptance) — **no independent read-back exists for a bot's own message**, so the action stays `EXECUTED_UNVERIFIED / NO_INDEPENDENT_READBACK` (canonical PARTIAL) until Gev confirms the message is visible in the chat. That confirmation is the second-source evidence a `VERIFIED_WRITE` would need.

## INT-WA — WhatsApp Business (official Cloud API)

**Required**

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `access_token` | System-user / app access token with `whatsapp_business_messaging` |
| `phone_number_id` | the business phone number id (Meta app → WhatsApp → API setup) |
| `verify_token` | any secret string; Meta sends it back in the webhook handshake |
| `app_secret` | the Meta app secret used to sign webhook requests (`X-Hub-Signature-256`) |
| `allowed_numbers` | comma-separated E.164 numbers whose messages count as business evidence |

**Optional**

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `business_account_id` | WABA id — events for another WABA are rejected as WRONG_TENANT |
| `expected_display_phone` | e.g. `+374 99 000 002` — identity VERIFIED only when the provider matches |
| `webhook_host` / `webhook_port` / `webhook_path` | listener binding (default `127.0.0.1:8788` `/webhooks/whatsapp`) |
| `observe_unknown` | keep messages from non-allowlisted numbers as UNTRUSTED evidence |

Template `~/.command-center/integrations/INT-WA.json`:

```json
{"access_token": "<token>", "phone_number_id": "111222333", "business_account_id": "555", "verify_token": "<random secret>", "app_secret": "<app secret>", "allowed_numbers": "+37499000001,+37499000002", "expected_display_phone": "+374 99 000 002", "webhook_host": "127.0.0.1", "webhook_port": 8788, "webhook_path": "/webhooks/whatsapp"}
```

**Activation steps** — 1) config outside Git, 2) start the listener explicitly (`python .claude/integrations/whatsapp_webhook.py`) behind a public HTTPS reverse proxy/tunnel (deployment, not code), 3) in the Meta app point the webhook at that URL with the `verify_token` → handshake VERIFIED (readiness shows `callback: VERIFIED`), 4) `integration.py certify` → identity VERIFIED → inbound messages arrive through the signed webhook → `chat.messages` REAL READ, 5) optional write certification: one `chat.send_text` (inside the 24-hour customer-service window) or `chat.send_template` (approved template) to an allowed number, Gev approves; the send is `AWAITING_PROVIDER_STATUS` until the delivery status arrives through the webhook, then reconciliation marks it VERIFIED.

---

## INT-B24 — Bitrix24 (incoming webhook, read-only)

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `webhook_url` | incoming webhook URL (`https://housenet.bitrix24.ru/rest/<user>/<code>/`) with read scopes only (crm, tasks, user) |
| `portal_domain` | `housenet.bitrix24.ru` — the expected portal; a different portal is refused as WRONG_TENANT |

Template `~/.command-center/integrations/INT-B24.json`:

```json
{"webhook_url": "https://housenet.bitrix24.ru/rest/1/<code>/", "portal_domain": "housenet.bitrix24.ru"}
```

Then `integration.py certify` → identity (profile) VERIFIED → crm.deals / crm.leads / tasks REAL READ. Writes stay declared (`tasks.create`, `crm.deal.update`, `crm.activity.create`) until a Gev-approved live certification.

---

## INT-MB — MikroBILL

**DEFERRED by Gev (2026-09-12).** No implementation work, no activation request, no nag in briefs. Billing-sourced KPIs report `UNAVAILABLE` and `TARGET_UNKNOWN` until the deferral is lifted; the readiness view shows `DEFERRED`.

---

## Scheduler (proactive routines)

Routines exist (`skill.py routine morning|midday|eod|weekly`) and run on demand. The scheduler is reported `NOT_CONFIGURED` until an external trigger (Windows Task Scheduler / cron) invokes `skill.py routine <name> --from-scheduler`, which writes the heartbeat. Nothing runs in the background by itself, and no routine sends anything anywhere: delivering a routine result to a chat or mailbox is an Action Runtime approval.
