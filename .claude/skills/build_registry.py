"""Canonical Skill Registry builder — SOURCE of truth for skill contracts. Emits registry.json.

REGISTRY QUALITY AUDIT (2026-09-10): 132 → see RETIRED below. Every retired id carries the survivor it merged
into and the reason. Rule applied: a skill survives only if it provides a capability no other skill provides
(distinct executor behaviour, distinct required input, or distinct routing target). Same executor + same input
+ same output = alias → merged. Tools are not skills → retired into tools_available/tool_intents.

Maturity here is a DECLARED TARGET only. certify.py computes the ACHIEVED level per skill from mapped evidence
and writes it back; engine.validate_registry() rejects any L3+ skill whose per-skill certification is missing,
failed, or stale (fingerprint mismatch after a contract/implementation change).
